### **Case Study: Advancing Healthcare Analysis through Data Insights**

### **Background**

You are a data analyst at HealthStat Solutions, a company specializing in healthcare analytics. You have been given two datasets: 'Patient Medical Records' and 'Hospital Treatment Details'. The 'Patient Medical Records' dataset contains detailed information on patients, including their age, gender, blood type, diagnosis, treatments, admission and discharge dates, and total bills. The 'Hospital Treatment Details' dataset provides insights into the hospitals treating these patients, including the treating doctor, room number, daily costs, treatment types, and recovery ratings.

In a healthcare industry that relies heavily on data to make informed decisions for patient care and hospital management, your role is crucial. Your task is to analyze these datasets, uncovering trends and insights that could improve patient outcomes and optimize hospital operations.

### **Objective**

As an analyst at HealthStat Solutions, your objective is to leverage Power BI for a deep dive into the provided healthcare datasets. This task encompasses meticulous data cleaning and sophisticated data modeling, utilizing DAX for advanced analytics. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, interactive dashboard in Power BI that presents a cohesive narrative of the healthcare data. This dashboard should serve as a tool to uncover and visualize important trends, such as the interplay between patient demographics and treatment outcomes, cost implications of various medical procedures, and overall hospital performance metrics. Your analysis will provide invaluable insights, aiding healthcare providers in enhancing patient care and operational efficiency, and positioning HealthStat Solutions at the forefront of healthcare analytics.
